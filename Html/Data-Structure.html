                <p>A data structure is a specialized format for <span class="points">organizing, managing, and
                        storing</span>
                    data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data
                    structures are suited
                    to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. Common data
                    structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps.
                    The choice of data structure affects the performance of algorithms and can significantly influence
                    the efficiency of a program.

                <p>At its core, a data structure is an organized collection of data, designed to enable efficient
                    operations on that data. This organization is based on specific <span class="points">rules or
                        logical</span> relationships,
                    which determine how data is stored and how it can be accessed. The main purpose of data structures
                    is to provide a systematic way to manage and manipulate data, making it easier to perform various
                    operations such as searching, sorting, inserting, updating, and deleting.

                        <h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>
                        <p>The efficiency of data structures lies in their ability to optimize these operations. For
                            example, some data structures are designed to allow rapid access to data, making them ideal
                            for applications where quick retrieval is crucial. Others may focus on minimizing the amount
                            of space required to store data, which is important in environments with limited memory
                            resources. Additionally, certain data structures are optimized for specific types of data or
                            operations, such as hierarchical data organization or sequential processing.</p>

                        <h2>KEY ASPECT:</h2>
                        <p>A key aspect of data structures is the concept of abstraction. Abstraction allows developers
                            to focus on the high-level operations and interactions with the data, without needing to
                            worry about the low-level details of how the data is physically stored in memory. This
                            separation of concerns is critical for developing complex systems, as it simplifies the
                            design and implementation processes, and enhances code maintainability and reusability.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Another <span class="points">important feature</span> of data structures is their ability to support
                    different operations and
                    algorithms. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the performance of these
                    algorithms, influencing factors such as time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers
                    to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input data,
                    while space complexity refers to the amount of memory required. Efficient data structures can help
                    minimize these complexities, leading to faster and more resource-efficient programs.</p>
                <p><span class="points">In real-world applications</span>, data structures play a vital role across
                    various domains. For example,
                    they are used in databases to manage and organize records, in operating systems for memory
                    management, in networking for data packet routing, and in software development for managing
                    collections of data elements. The choice of the appropriate data structure depends on the specific
                    requirements of the application, such as the types of operations needed, the frequency of these
                    operations, and the constraints on resources.</p>
                <p><span class="points">In summary,</span> data structures are essential tools in computing, providing a
                    framework for efficiently
                    organizing and managing data. They enable developers to design systems that are both efficient and
                    scalable, capable of handling large volumes of data and complex operations. The careful selection
                    and implementation of data structures are crucial for optimizing the performance and resource
                    utilization of software applications.</p>

                <h1>Types Of <span class="overview">Data Structure:</span></h1>
                <p>
                    Data structures can be broadly categorized into two main types: linear and non-linear. Each type
                    includes several specific data structures that are suited to different tasks and applications.
                </p>
                <h2 id="LinearDs">1- <span class="overview">Linear Data Structure:</span></h2>
                <p>Linear data structures are a type of data structure where elements are arranged sequentially, one
                    after another. Each element is connected to its previous and next elements, forming a linear
                    sequence. This arrangement allows for straightforward traversal, insertion, and deletion of
                    elements, making linear data structures fundamental in computer science.</p>

                    <p>
                        An array is a collection of elements, all of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory
                        locations. Each element can be accessed directly using an index, making arrays efficient for
                        random access. Arrays have a fixed size, meaning their capacity is determined at the time of
                        creation and cannot be changed dynamically. They are widely used for storing collections of
                        data when the size is known in advance.

                    <p>
                        Unlike arrays, linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference
                        (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This dynamic nature allows linked lists to grow
                        and shrink as needed, making them more flexible than arrays. There are various types of
                        linked lists, including singly linked lists (each node points to the next), doubly linked
                        lists (each node points to both the next and the previous nodes), and circular linked lists
                        (the last node points back to the first node).

                        A stack is a collection of elements with a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order. This means that
                        the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are implemented
                        using arrays or linked lists and support two main operations: push (adding an element to the
                        top) and pop (removing the top element). Stacks are used in various applications, such as
                        function call management, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms in software.

                    <p>
                        In a stack array implementation, the stack is represented using a fixed-size array. The
                        stack has a pointer called the "top" that indicates the index of the last added element.
                        Operations include push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing the top element).
                        The array implementation is simple and allows for O(1) time complexity for both operations.
                        However, it requires predefining the maximum size, which can lead to wasted space or
                        overflow if the stack exceeds its capacity.

                    <p>
                        In a stack linked list implementation, the stack is represented as a linked list where each
                        node contains the data and a reference to the next node. The "top" of the stack is
                        represented by the head of the linked list. The push operation involves creating a new node
                        and linking it at the beginning of the list, while the pop operation removes the head node.
                        This implementation allows for dynamic resizing, as it doesn't require a fixed size and can
                        grow or shrink as needed. Additionally, it provides efficient O(1) time complexity for both
                        push and pop operations.

                    <p>
                        A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In
                        a queue, elements are added at one end, called the "rear," and removed from the opposite
                        end, called the "front." This structure ensures that the first element added is the first to
                        be removed, similar to a line of people waiting for service. Queues are commonly used in
                        scenarios where order needs to be preserved, such as task scheduling, buffering data
                        streams, and managing requests in web servers. The primary operations on a queue include
                        enqueue (adding an element to the rear) and dequeue (removing an element from the front).
                        Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, and can also be extended to support
                        priority queues, where elements are removed based on priority rather than order.

                    <h2>Queue Array Implementation:</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a queue array implementation, the queue is represented using a fixed-size array. The
                        "front" and "rear" indices track the positions for removing and adding elements,
                        respectively. The enqueue operation adds an element at the rear, and the dequeue operation
                        removes an element from the front. To efficiently use the array, the indices are often
                        wrapped around in a circular manner, known as a circular queue. While this implementation
                        allows O(1) time complexity for both enqueue and dequeue operations, it requires predefined
                        maximum capacity, which may lead to unused space or overflow if the queue becomes full.

                    <h2>Queue Linkedlist Implementation:</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a queue linked list implementation, the queue is represented as a linked list with
                        pointers to both the front and rear nodes. Each node contains data and a reference to the
                        next node. The enqueue operation involves creating a new node and linking it at the rear,
                        while the dequeue operation removes the front node. This implementation allows the queue to

                        operations are efficient, with O(1) time complexity. This flexibility makes it suitable for
                        scenarios where the number of elements can vary widely.

                <p>
                    Non-linear data structures are types of data structures where elements are not arranged in a
                    sequential order. Unlike linear data structures, where elements are connected end-to-end, non-linear
                    data structures allow elements to be connected in multiple ways, reflecting more complex
                    relationships among the data. This structure enables efficient representation and manipulation of
                    hierarchical, networked, or clustered data.

                            A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single root node and
                            potentially multiple levels of child nodes. Each node in a tree can have zero or more child
                            nodes, and each child node has exactly one parent node, except for the root node, which has
                            no parent.
