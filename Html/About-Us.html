                Our motivation for creating this project states from a shared desire to bridge the gap between
                theoretical
                concepts and practical understanding in computer science. We recognized the importance of visual aids in
                comprehending complex topics such as memory storage and sorting algorithm. <br><br> By developing the
                '<u><mark>
                    Machine MindMaps
                </mark></u>', we aim to provide students with an intuitive platform where they can
                interactively explore these concepts in real-time. Our goal is to demystify the inner workings of
                computer systems and empower learners with hands-on experience that reinforces classroom teaching.
                Through this project, we hope to inspire curiosty, foster deeper learning, and equip our peers with the
                tools they need to succeed in their academic and professional endeavors.
